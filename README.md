# Comparing the long-term risk of stroke/MI in patients after coronavirus infection with other respiratory infections

## Project description

COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease. However, it is also a systemic illness with the widespread expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 in infected individuals leading to prothrombotic and hyperinflammation. Thus, this severe viral infection may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular diseases.

Any elevated risk of cardiovascular disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be put into the context of risk after other acute viral infections, such as influenza or pneumonia, to allow a better understanding of the COVID-19 specific mechanisms that lead to complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis, and to understand the relative burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) after COVID-19. This work will be an important contribution to our understanding of the clinical relevance of any endothelial or systemic inflammation associated with infection and have implications for new effective prevention strategies including therapeutic targets. 

The inflammatory responses to COVID-19 may make underlying cardiovascular disease more likely to manifest. The comparison between COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will allow us to assess whether COVID-19 is associated with an elevated risk of adverse CVD outcomes above and beyond that of other respiratory infections and to show whether the high-risk periods are different between COVID-19 and viral influenza or pneumonia (non-COVID+) infections to better define when precautions are most effective.

Our aims are:

1. To quantify if the risk of cardiovascular diseases after COVID-19 infection is higher than non-COVID+ infection in general or in particular populations;
2. Define whether the increased risk persists longer with COVID-19 than non-COVID+ infection;
3. To understand whether subsequent risk varies according to whether patients infected with COVID-19 or non-COVID+ are hospitalised or not hospitalised.
